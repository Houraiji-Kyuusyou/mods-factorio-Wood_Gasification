# Mods: Factorio: Wood Gasification
This is the repository for the Wood Gasification mod for Factorio.

Wood gasification turns 10 units of wood into 20 units of petroleum gas and 6 units of tar. 32 units of tar can be turned into 1 unit of solid fuel or 20 units of heavy oil. This mod is meant to kick-start your chemical plants.

This mod is an update for the 0.14 mod 'Wood Gas' which was discontinued; It's my attempt to upgrade 'Wood Gas' (0.14 only) to 0.15+ and continue the development of the mod. The original author ('mooklepticon') of 'Wood Gas' has given me his blessing to continue this mod.
