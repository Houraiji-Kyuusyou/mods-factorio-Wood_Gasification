# Mods: Factorio: Wood Gasification
This is the repository for the Wood Gasification mod for Factorio.

Wood gasification uses a chemical lab to turn 10 units of wood into 20 units of petroleum gas and 6 units of tar. 32 units of tar can be turned into 1 unit of solid fuel or 20 units of heavy oil. Advanced wood gasification processes 28 wood and 50 water into 35 units of heavy oil, 15 units of light oil and 20 petroleum gas using a refinery. This mod is meant to kickstart your chemical plants.

This mod comes in 4 languages:
- English (cappie)
- Dutch (cappie)
- German (Reysuke)
- Russian (Va7ya)

# Continuation of unmaintained mod
This mod is an update for the 0.14 mod 'Wood Gas' which was discontinued; It's my attempt to upgrade 'Wood Gas' (0.14 only) to 0.15+ and continue the development of the mod. The original author ('mooklepticon') of 'Wood Gas' has given me his blessing to continue this mod.

# Translators wanted!
I would love to be able to support even more languages like French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese. If you would like to help, please take a look at the repository, or if you don't know how to do that Github thing, just contact me via https://mods.factorio.com/ and I'll add your translated strings from the locale-file to the mods' repository.
