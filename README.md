# Mods: Factorio: Wood Gasification
This is the repository for the Wood Gasification mod for Factorio.

Wood gasification turns 4 logs (or 8 planks) into 4 petroleum gas, 2 units of tar, and 1 piece of coal. 40 tar can be turned into solid fuel or heavy oil. It's meant to be a nice way to kickstart your chemical plants.

This mod is an update for the 0.14 mod 'Wood Gas' which was discontinued; It's my attempt to upgrade 'Wood Gas' (0.14 only) to 0.15+ and continue the development of the mod. The original author of 'Wood Gas' may contact me and join if he wants (you're always welcome to continue on it). I just wanted to have it in my 0.15+ games :)
